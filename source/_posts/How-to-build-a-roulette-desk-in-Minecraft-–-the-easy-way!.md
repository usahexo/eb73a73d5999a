#  How to build a roulette desk in Minecraft – the easy way!

Ready to up your Minecraft game? Here’s how to build a roulette desk in Minecraft – the easy way! This project is perfect for beginner Minecrafters, and you only need a few basic supplies. Let’s get started!

## The supplies you’ll need

* 24 blocks of any type (I used wooden blocks)

* 1 sign block

* 1 rail block

* 2 minecart tracks

* 2 Powered Rail Blocks (if you want the desk to move)
8 steps to make your own Roulette Desk: 



  1. Place 12 blocks in a square shape. The middle two blocks should be the sign block, and the outer blocks should be the rail block. If you’re using a Powered Rail Block, put it in the middle of the square.

   2. On each side of the square,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) place one minecart track pointing inward.

   3. Connect the four corners of the square with more minecart tracks, so that the desk can move around freely.

   4. To make the top of the desk, place another 12 blocks in a square shape. The middle two blocks should be the rail block, and the outer blocks should be the sign block.

   5. On each side of the square, place one powered rail block pointing inward. This will create a “lip” on each side of the desk to hold your items in place.
