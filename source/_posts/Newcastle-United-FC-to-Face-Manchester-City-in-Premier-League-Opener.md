#  Newcastle United FC to Face Manchester City in Premier League Opener


The English Premier League officially kicks off this weekend with Newcastle United FC set to take on defending champions Manchester City. It should be an exciting matchup, as both teams have plenty of firepower and should provide a good test for each other.

Newcastle comes into the season with some question marks, as they have lost several key players in the offseason. However, they still have some quality players on their roster, including new signing Yoshinori Muto. They will need to rely on him and players like Salomon Rondon if they hope to compete in the Premier League this year.

Manchester City is coming into the season as the heavy favorites to win the title again. They have arguably the best squad in the league, and they showed their power by beating Chelsea in last year’s Community Shield. However, they can’t take Newcastle lightly and should expect a tough match on Sunday.

It should be a great game to kickoff the Premier League season, so make sure to tune in this weekend.

#  Manchester City vs Newcastle United: Odds and Betting Tips

The Premier League fixtures continue to come thick and fast as Manchester City take on Newcastle United at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday lunchtime.

Pep Guardiola’s side have made an impressive start to the new season and currently sit top of the table, five points clear of title rivals Liverpool. They will be looking to continue their good form with a win against Newcastle, who have had a mixed start to the campaign.

Newcastle have only won one of their six Premier League matches this season, but they did manage to beat Manchester United 3-2 at St James’ Park in early September. They will be hoping for another upset against City on Saturday, but they are likely to face a tough task against the reigning champions.

Manchester City are unbeaten in their last 21 Premier League matches and they have only conceded four goals so far this season. They are strong favourites to win this match and they are priced at odds of 1/5 with most bookmakers.

Newcastle are offered at odds of 16/1 to pull off an upset victory, while a draw is available at odds of 9/2.

Both teams have scored in each of Manchester City’s last four home games in the Premier League and there is likely to be plenty of goals in this match. Over 2.5 goals is available at odds of 3/4, while over 3.5 goals is priced at 5/6.

#  What are the Odds on Newcastle United FC Winning the Premier League?

Premier League football is back, and with it comes a new set of odds on who will win the title. Coming into the 2018/19 season, defending champions Manchester City are favourites, but there are a few teams that could give them a run for their money. One of those teams is Newcastle United FC.

 Newcastle finished in 10th place last season, and they will be looking to improve on that this year. With manager Rafael Benítez at the helm, the club has a good chance of making it into the top six. If they can do that, they will be in contention for the Premier League title.

So, what are the odds on Newcastle winning the Premier League? As of right now, they are at 33/1 to take home the trophy. That may seem like a long shot, but it’s not impossible. Other teams that are considered long shots include Wolverhampton Wanderers (50/1) and Leicester City (66/1).

Of course, while Newcastle may have chances to win the Premier League, they aren’t without competition. Tottenham Hotspur (9/2), Liverpool FC (11/2), and Chelsea FC (13/2) are all considered serious contenders this year. So far during the pre-season, Newcastle have looked promising but they will need to continue to perform well in order to win the Premier League.

If you’re feeling lucky, you can always put down a bet on Newcastle United FC winning the Premier League. The odds may be against them, but it’s definitely worth a shot!

#  Newcastle United FC vs Chelsea FC: Betting Preview and Prediction

This Saturday, Newcastle United will be welcoming Chelsea to St. James’ Park for their Premier League opener. The home side is considered the underdog in this matchup and is valued at 3.00 to take all three points, while the Blues are listed at 1.50 . [Sports Interaction](https://www.sportsinteraction.com/en/sports/soccer/epl/newcastle-united-fc-chelsea-fc- betting/? nobleman=true) has Antonio Conte’s men as favourites to win, but there’s plenty of value to be had on Rafa Benitez’s squad here.

 Chelsea finished in fifth place last season and will be looking to make a return to the Champions League. They do have some new additions this season, with Alvaro Morata and Tiemoue Bakayoko joining the club, but they will be without Eden Hazard who is still recovering from an ankle injury. The Blues also lost out to Arsenal in the Community Shield last weekend, so they may not be at their best heading into this clash.

Newcastle, on the other hand, narrowly avoided relegation last season and will be looking to improve on their finish this time around. The Magpies have added some new players of their own this summer, with Jacob Murphy and Javier Manquillo joining the club. They did lose striker Mitrovic to Fulham though, so they may struggle for goals in this match.

Looking at the odds for this game, Chelsea does seem like the obvious choice, but there could be some value on Newcastle here at 3.00 . The Magpies have been playing well in pre-season and should put up a good fight against last year’s fifth-place team. I’d recommend betting on Newcastle +1.5 at 2.10 as they should at least get one goal in this game
