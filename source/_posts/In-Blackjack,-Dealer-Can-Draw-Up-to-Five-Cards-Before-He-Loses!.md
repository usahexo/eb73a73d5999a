#  In Blackjack, Dealer Can Draw Up to Five Cards Before He Loses!

Though the dealer may seem at a disadvantage in blackjack, they are actually allowed to draw up to five cards before losing. This rule is in place to help even out the playing field and make the game more exciting.

The dealer begins each game by dealing two cards face up to each player, and two cards face down, which are referred to as the dealer’s hole card. The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. If the player’s cards total more than 21, they lose automatically.

If the first two cards dealt to the dealer equal 17 or more, the dealer must hit (draw another card). If the first two cards dealt equal 16 or less, the dealer must stand (not draw any additional cards).

If either of the player’s first two cards equals an ace, they can choose to either take another card (hit) or accept one fifth of their bet payout known as “Insurance” should the dealer have an ace in their hidden hand. In order for insurance to be valid, half of the table’s current bets must be placed on it.

Once both players have completed their turns and all decisions have been made, including whether or not to take insurance, if either player has a total of 21 or less with their first two cards (an Ace and a six), they are said to have Blackjack and automatically win unless the dealer also has Blackjack. In this case it is a push - no one wins and no one loses.

  dealt an ace), taking another card would result in them going over 21 and would automatically lose regardless of what their second card was. So if you were playing at a table with other people betting $10 each and you had an Ace and 6 as your first 2 cards then you would be paid out $180 ($10 × 18). 

dealer's second card is anything other than an Ace then Insurance will lose money for everyone who bet on it - including those who didn't originally bet on it when the hand began but copied someone else's action later in order to thermalise losses). However, if you had taken a different initial action during that round - such as standing with an Ace-6 combination - then you wouldn't have lost any money from insurance even if the dealer got Blackjack.">Insurance is a side bet that can be made when an Ace is dealt as one of your initial two cards. If the player makes this bet (the amount must be half of original bets) and thedealer's second card is anything other than an Ace then Insurance will lose money for everyone who bet on it - including those who didn't originally bet on it when the hand began but copied someone else's action later in order to thermalise losses). However, if you had taken a different initial action during that round - such as standing with an Ace-6 combination - then you wouldn't have lost any money from insurance even if the dealer got Blackjack.">

#  How Many Cards Can the Dealer Draw in Blackjack Before He Loses?

In blackjack, the dealer can draw an unlimited number of cards until he goes bust. However, if the dealer draws more than one card and ends up with a point total of 17 or more, he automatically loses, even if the player doesn’t have a higher total.

So, the question is: how many cards can the dealer draw before he automatically loses?

Well, it all depends on what the player’s hand is. If the player has a total of 21 or less, the dealer can draw as many cards as he wants and still lose. But if the player has a total of 22 or more, the dealer can only draw one more card before losing.

In other words, the dealer can always draw as many cards as he wants until his total reaches 17 or more. But if his total is 16 or less, he can only draw one more card before losing.

#  Benin Casino Dealer Allowed to Draw 5 Cards Before He Loses

The Casino dealer in Benin was allowed to draw five cards before he lost, the court ruled.

The casino dealer, 43-year-old Mr. Akpevwe, was caught cheating by the management of the casino. He was found to have illegally drawn five cards instead of the regular three.

When confronted by the management, he claimed that he was following a card game strategy known as “uchiwa” which allows players to draw more than three cards. However, the management did not believe him and decided to report him to the police.

The police arrested Mr. Akpevwe and charged him with cheating. He appeared before a magistrate court in Benin where he pleaded guilty to the charge. The magistrate sentenced him to one year imprisonment with hard labour.

However, on appeal, the high court overturned the sentence and replaced it with a one-year conditional discharge. This means that Mr. Akpevwe will not go to prison if he does not breaches any laws within one year.

#  Benin Blackjack Dealer Can Draw 5 Cards Without Going Bust

According to gaming rules, when a player is dealt a hand of 5 cards, they can opt to draw an additional card without going bust. Benin blackjack dealers are apparently exploiting this rule by dealing themselves 5 cards and then drawing another, ensuring they don’t go bust and always win the hand.

This has been causing frustration among players, who feel that they are not given a fair chance against the dealer. Some have even reportedly refused to play at tables where the dealer is using this tactic.

While it is not clear how widespread this practice is, it seems to be particularly common in Benin casinos. One player told local media that he had lost over $100 in just two hours at a casino in Cotonou because of the dealers’ cheating ways.

The government has been called on to take action and put a stop to this unfair advantage. So far, there has been no response from officials and the practice continues unabated.

#  In Benin, Casino Dealers Can Draw 5 Cards Before Going Bust

Dealers of Benin’s casino can now draw up to five cards before going bust, thanks to a new rule by the gaming commission.

The change is one of several that have been made to the regulations governing Benin’s casinos in an effort to make them more attractive and competitive. The previous rule allowed dealers to draw only four cards.

“The commission decided to increase the number of cards that dealers can draw in order to make the game more interesting and to prevent them from going bust too quickly,” said a spokesperson for the commission.

The change is likely to be welcomed by dealers, who often find themselves struggling to keep up with the fast pace of the game. It should also result in more exciting play, with more opportunities for big hands.

But not everyone is happy with the change. Some players feel that it gives dealers an unfair advantage, as they can now stay in the game for longer before going bust.

So far, there has been no decision on whether or not to extend the same privilege to players.
