#  How does compulsive gambling affect families?

Gambling can have a devastating effect on families. The National Council on Problem Gambling reports that as many as one in six American families are directly affected by problem gambling. This includes spouses, children, and other family members of the gambler.

The most common effects of problem gambling on families are financial problems and emotional turmoil. Financially, problem gamblers often rack up large debts as a result of their gambling. They may miss work or pawn cherished belongings in order to get money to gamble with. This can create immense financial stress for the entire family.

Emotionally, problem gambling can cause tremendous conflict within families. Spouses and children of problem gamblers often feel angry, frustrated, and helpless. They may feel like they are constantly walking on eggshells, trying not to upset the gambler. This can be extremely stressful and draining.

Problem gambling also can have serious health consequences for family members. Children of problem gamblers are more likely to suffer from mental health problems such as depression and anxiety disorders. They also are more likely to begin gambling at an early age.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it is important to seek help ASAP. There are many resources available for those who need assistance, including counseling and support groups. Families affected by problem gambling deserve compassion and support – don’t hesitate to reach out for help.
