In 1893, French author Guy de Maupassant published a short story called La Machine à Pillecer (The Penny-Pinching Machine). In it, a miser invents a slot machine that gives the player the best chance of winning big. While this story is fictional, there are real-life penny slots that offer better odds than most other casino games. Let’s take a look at some of the best options available.

One of the most popular penny slots in America is Wheel of Fortune. This game offers a top payout of $100,000 and has an average return to player (RTP) of 95.02%. Other games with high RTPs include Double Diamond (95.98%), Da Vinci Diamonds (96.59%), and Triple Diamond (97.06%).

Slots players looking for big payouts don’t need to stick to penny games, either. Some machines offer progressives that can award millions of dollars to lucky winners. For example, Megabucks has a top payout of $10 million and an RTP of 96.01%. Other high-paying progressive slots include Major Millions (96.49%) and King Cashalot (96.02%).

Of course, not every spin on these machines will be a winner, but by playing the games with the best odds, you’re more likely to come out ahead in the long run. So next time you’re at the casino, skip the high-stakes games and put your money into a penny slot instead – you might just hit it big!
