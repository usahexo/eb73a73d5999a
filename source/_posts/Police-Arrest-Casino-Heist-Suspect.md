#  Police Arrest Casino Heist Suspect

Police say they have apprehended the suspect responsible for the casino heist that took place last month. The suspect, who is being identified as John Doe, is said to have stolen nearly $1 million from the casino.

Authorities say that they were able to track down Doe through CCTV footage and connects him to the robbery through forensic evidence. Doe is currently in custody and will be facing multiple charges related to the theft.
