#  What is the Ranking of a Royal Flush in Poker?

There are a few different ranking systems in poker, and royal flush is one the of the most common ones. Royal flush is a hand that has five cards of the same suit, with the Ace being high. In some rankings, it is better than a straight flush, which is a hand that has five cards of the same suit in consecutive order. In others, a royal flush and a straight flush are considered to be the same thing.

In general, though, royal flush is considered to be the best possible hand in poker. It's very rare to get one, and most people would likely fold if they were faced with this hand unless they had a very strong betting strategy.

#  Poker Hand Rankings: Texas Hold'em Style

When playing Texas Hold’em, it is important to be aware of the hand rankings. Understanding which hands are better than others will help you win more money in the long run.

The best possible hand in poker is a Royal Flush, which is made up of an Ace, King, Queen, Jack and Ten, all of the same suit. A Royal Flush is an extremely rare hand and is usually only seen at the high end of tournaments.

The next best hand is a Straight Flush, which is made up of five consecutive cards all of the same suit. These are also very rare hands and can often result in a big payout.

Next on the list are four of a kind, which consist of four cards of the same rank. This hand is usually very strong and can beat most other hands with ease.

After that come three of a kind, two pairs and one pair. The ranking for these hands goes from highest to lowest as follows: four of a kind, Straight Flush, three of a kind, two pairs, one pair.

Finally, the lowest hand in poker is known as a high card. This hand consists of any five cards that are not in any of the above categories. If two players have the same high card then the rank of their second card will determine the winner.

#  The Best Poker Hands in Order

Building a strong poker hand takes more than just getting one of each rank. You also need to make sure that your cards are suited and connected. Here is a list of the best possible hands, in order from weakest to strongest:

2♥ 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ 6♥ 7♥ 8♥ 9♥ 10♥ J♥ Q♥ K♥ A♦ 2♦ 3♦ 4♦ 5♦ 6♦ 7♦ 8♦ 9♦ 10♦ J♣ Q♣ K♣ A♠

As you can see, the best hand is A♠ K♠Q♣J♦. This is followed by A♣ K♦Q♦J♣, then A♥K♣Q♠J♠. If you are ever lucky enough to hold all four of these cards, you can be sure that you are holding the best hand in the game!
