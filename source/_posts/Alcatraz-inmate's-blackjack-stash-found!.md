#  Alcatraz inmate's blackjack stash found!

San Francisco, CA - In a surprising discovery, officials at Alcatraz federal prison announced on Tuesday that a cache of blackjack cards and chips was found hidden in the cell of an inmate who died in 1988.

The inmate, George "Machine Gun" Kelly, was serving a life sentence for his role in a series of kidnappings and murders associated with the Prohibition-era gangster scene. Officials believe that Kelly may have been using the blackjack stash to bribe guards into providing him with special treatment or concessions.

"This is a remarkable discovery," said Alcatraz Historian Brad Bauman. "We knew that Machine Gun Kelly was quite the gambler, but we had no idea he was hiding this kind of treasure."

According to Bauman, the blackjack stash includes dozens of cards and chips made of ivory and bone, as well as a number of gold coins. It is not clear how long the stash has been hidden or whether any other prisoners knew about it.

Although officials have not yet decided what to do with the stash, they are considering displaying it at the museum on Alcatraz Island.

#  Alcatraz inmates may have hidden blackjack stash on the island

It was recently announced that a stash of blackjack cards was found on Alcatraz Island. Some officials believe that this may have been used by inmates as part of a gambling ring. While it is unclear exactly how the cards ended up on the island, it is possible that they were hidden by prisoners during their time there.

This isn't the first time that something has been found on Alcatraz which may have been used by inmates. For example, in 2011 a cell phone was discovered which had been hidden in the concrete wall. It's possible that there are other items out there which were used by inmates and have yet to be discovered.

The discovery of the blackjack cards has already led to some new information about what went on at Alcatraz. For example, it was revealed that there may have been a gambling ring operating at the prison. This could help to explain how some of the inmates managed to make money while they were incarcerated.

It's still not clear who hid the blackjack cards on the island or why they did it. However, officials are hopeful that this discovery will provide further insight into what happened at Alcatraz during its time as a prison.

#  Inmate's blackjack stash may have been found at Alcatraz

In a recent development in a long-running criminal case, authorities may have finally located the stash of blackjack cards and money that an inmate hid on Alcatraz over 40 years ago.

The inmate, Jerry Butterfield, was incarcerated at Alcatraz for a number of years in the early 1970s. While there, he is believed to have stashed a small bag containing playing cards and over $1000 in today's money in a hidden crevice on the island.

Authorities began investigating the possibility of Butterfield's blackjack stash as recently as last year, but it wasn't until this month that they received what they believe to be credible information about its whereabouts. A group of scuba divers recently discovered a small bag hidden among some rocks near the island's abandoned prison hospital. Although they haven't yet been able to confirm that the bag contains playing cards and money, authorities are confident that it is related to Butterfield's case.

Butterfield has been dead for over 25 years, but his family is reportedly very excited about the prospect of finally recovering his lost belongings. "My dad always talked about how he'd hidden some money and cards on Alcatraz," said one of Butterfield's daughters. "It would be really great if we could find them and give them back to him."

#  Search for blackjack stash on Alcatraz continues

The search for the lost blackjack stash on Alcatraz continued this week, as a team of investigators used new technology to try and locate the money.

The investigation was sparked by a letter that was found in the prison archives, which allegedly claimed that a group of inmates had hidden a large sum of money somewhere on the island. The inmates – who were said to be part of a blackjack ring – were allegedly planning to use the money to bribe their way out of prison.

Although the letter has never been confirmed to be authentic, authorities have decided to follow up on the lead anyway. A team of investigators recently used ground-penetrating radar (GPR) technology to try and locate the stash, but so far they have come up empty-handed.

Alcatraz is known for being a difficult place to escape from, so it’s not surprising that the investigators have had difficulty locating the money. In fact, the only successful escape from Alcatraz was in 1962, when three inmates managed to cross the bay and make their way to San Francisco.

Despite their lack of success so far, authorities are still hopeful that they will find the blackjack stash. In addition to GPR technology, they are also using cadaver dogs and metal detectors in their search.

#  Alcatraz prison officials find inmate's blackjack stash

In a recent discovery, Alcatraz prison officials found an inmate's stash of blackjack cards and money. Inmates are not allowed to have gambling paraphernalia, so the cards and money will be confiscated.

Officials believe that the inmate has been using the blackjack cards to make money in the prison. It is unclear how much money the inmate has made, but officials estimate that it is in the thousands of dollars.

The inmate is facing disciplinary action for possessing contraband, and he may also lose some of his privileges. Officials say that they will continue to investigate the matter and try to determine who helped the inmate smuggle in the blackjack cards.
