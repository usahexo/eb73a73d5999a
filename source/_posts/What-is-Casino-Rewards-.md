#  How does this work?

This repository contains a simple web application that demonstrates how the File API can be used to read and write files.

When the app starts, it reads the contents of the file "example.txt" and displays them in the browser. It then writes new content to the file "new-example.txt".

To try it out, just click on the "File API demo" link below.

## How to use the File API

The File API provides a way for web applications to read and write files on the user's computer. It consists of two main interfaces:

* The [File object](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/dom/#file) allows you to get information about a file, such as its name and size. * The [FileReader object](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started-with-the-filereader/) allows you to read the contents of a file into memory.

The following example demonstrates how to use the File API to read and write files:

<html> <head> <title>File API Demo</title> <script src="fileapi_demo.js"></script> </head> <body> <div id="output"></div> <form action=""> Enter your name: <input type="text" id="name"/> <input type="submit"/> </form> </body> </html> <!-- fileapi_demo.js --> // This script demonstrates how to use the File API to read and write files var output = document.getElementById("output"); var input = document.getElementById("name"); function handleSubmit() { var name = input.value; output.innerHTML = "Hello, " + name + "!"; } input.addEventListener("submit", handleSubmit, false); // Read the contents of "example.txt" into memory var reader = new FileReader(); reader .onloadend = function() { output .innerHTML = this .result; } reader .readAsText(new File("example.txt"), 'utf8'); // Write new content to "new-example2txt" var writer = new FileWriter(); writer .onwriteend = function() { output .innerHTML = this .result; } writer .write(name); writer .close();
