#  What will be the fate of Newcastle United FC under the ownership of Mike Ashley?

When Mike Ashley acquired Newcastle United FC in 2007, there were high hopes among the club’s fans that he would invest in the team and help them achieve success on the pitch. However, over the past 10 years Ashley has been anything but a benevolent owner, instead using the club as a personal toy and asset to line his own pockets.

The latest debacle involving Newcastle United involves Sports Direct, Ashley’s retail chain, which is owed £14 million in unpaid sponsorship money by the club. This is just one example of the type of financial mismanagement that has become synonymous with Newcastle United during Ashley’s ownership.

In addition to financial troubles, Newcastle United have also experienced a dramatic decline in performance under Ashley. The team was relegated from the Premier League in 2009 and has not been able to return since. This is in stark contrast to the days when Newcastle United were regular contenders for European competition.

The future looks bleak for Newcastle United under Mike Ashley’s ownership. Unless Ashley undergoes a drastic change in his management style, it is likely that the club will continue to experience financial difficulties and poor performances on the pitch.

#  What will be the club's ultimate goal under Rafa Benitez?

The Newcastle United club is coming off of a disappointing 10th place finish in the Premier League last season. Manager Rafa Benitez has been brought in to right the ship and is looking to set the club's ultimate goal as returning to the Premier League's top eight.

The Magpies struggled offensively throughout last season, scoring only 41 goals in 38 league matches. Benitez will be hoping new signings such as striker Dwight Gayle and midfielder Matt Ritchie can help improve that number. Defensively, Newcastle was fairly solid, conceding only 44 goals. If they can replicate that success this season while also scoring more goals, they should be able to make a push for a top eight finish.

Fans of the club will certainly be hoping for a return to the Premier League's big time, but it won't come easy. The clubs around them in the table have all made some strong signings themselves this offseason and will be looking to improve on their own performances from last year. Nonetheless, if Rafa Benitez can get the most out of his players and steer Newcastle United back into Europe, it would be seen as a huge success.

#  What will be the key to turning the club's fortunes around?

There is no question that a club's fortunes can be dramatically turned around with the right changes. However, what will be the key to turning the club's fortunes around?

The first thing that must be done is to take an honest look at the team and identify the areas that need the most improvement. Once these have been identified, it is important to put together a plan of action and make sure everyone involved understands their role in ensuring its success.

Getting the right players in place is essential, and this can be a difficult task, especially if the club is not able to offer high salaries. However, working with agents and other clubs to identify talent that may be available for a reasonable price can be successful if done correctly.

Once the players are in place, it is important to create an atmosphere within the club that encourages success. This means establishing clear rules and expectations and making sure everyone involved is held accountable. The players must also buy into the new system and be willing to work hard to achieve success.

With the right combination of players, attitude and planning, any club can turn their fortunes around and become a successful organization.

#  What will be their biggest challenge this season?

The Golden State Warriors will undoubtedly be one of the top teams in the NBA this season. However, they may face some challenges along the way. Their biggest challenge this season could be their lack of experience playing together. With so many new faces on the team, it may take some time for them to gel and become a cohesive unit. Another potential challenge could be their competition in the Western Conference. With teams like the Rockets, Spurs and Thunder all vying for a spot in the playoffs, the Warriors will have to work hard to stay ahead of the pack. Nevertheless, with players like Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant on their roster, they are definitely a team to watch out for this season.
