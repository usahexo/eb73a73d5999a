        <h1 id="What-are-the-five-choices"><a href="#What-are-the-five-choices" class="headerlink" title="What are the five choices?"></a>What are the five choices?</h1><p>In the movie “ 500 Days of Summer “, Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) reflects on whether or not he and Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) had a genuine relationship.Near the beginning of the film, Tom lays out the five choices everyone has in life:</p>
<ol>
<li>You can do what you’re told.</li>
<li>You can do what you want.</li>
<li>You can do what somebody else wants you to do.</li>
<li>You can do what you think is right.</li>
<li>You can give up.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tom Hansen: “There are only five things you can do in life: be someone’s slave, be someone’s boss, be someone’s puppet, be yourself, or give up.” </p>
<p>Which one of these options would you choose if faced with a life-altering decision? For some people, following the status quo may be the easiest option; others may feel pressured to make choices that others want them to make instead of choosing what makes them happy; still others may feel lost and unsure of what the right answer is . However, there are proponents of each option who would argue passionately for their choice – so which side are you on?</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-first-choice"><a href="#What-is-the-first-choice" class="headerlink" title="What is the first choice?"></a>What is the first choice?</h1><p>In a time when people are inundated with choices, what is the first choice you make? Do you choose what is easy or do you choose what is right?</p>
<p>For some people, the first choice is the easiest one. They want to do what feels good in the moment and they don’t think about the consequences. This can lead to problems later on when they have to deal with the consequences of their actions.</p>
<p>For other people, the first choice is the one that is right for them. They think about what is best for themselves and for others. They may not always make the easy choice, but it is the right one for them.</p>
<p>What is your first choice?</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-second-choice"><a href="#What-is-the-second-choice" class="headerlink" title="What is the second choice?"></a>What is the second choice?</h1><p>The second choice is always important to consider. In many cases, the second choice is the most important decision you will make in your life. This is especially true when it comes to your career. You need to find a job that you love, and one that will make you happy.</p>
<p>There are a few things that you need to think about when making your second choice. First, think about what you are passionate about. What do you love to do? What makes you happy? Once you have an idea of what you are passionate about, start looking for jobs in that field.</p>
<p>It’s also important to think about your skills and abilities. What are you good at? What can you do well? Once you have an idea of your skills and abilities, start looking for jobs that match those skills.</p>
<p>Finally, think about your lifestyle and what is important to you. Are you willing to relocate for a job? Are there certain hours or days that you need to work? How much traveling is required? Thinking about these things will help narrow down your choices.</p>
<p>When it comes to making your second choice, the most important thing is to be realistic. Don’t choose a job just because it’s what you think you should do. Choose a job that fits who you are and what you want out of life.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-third-choice"><a href="#What-is-the-third-choice" class="headerlink" title="What is the third choice?"></a>What is the third choice?</h1><p>The third choice is a difficult decision to make. Often, there are pros and cons to both options and it can be hard to choose between them. In these cases, the third choice can be a very valuable option.</p>
<p>The third choice can provide an alternative to the two main choices and can offer a different perspective on the problem. It can also provide a way to combine the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>When making a decision, it is important to consider all of the options. The third choice can be an important part of the process and can help to ensure that the best decision is made.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-fourth-choice"><a href="#What-is-the-fourth-choice" class="headerlink" title="What is the fourth choice?"></a>What is the fourth choice?</h1><p>In the U.S. Presidential election of 2016, there were three candidates on the ballot: Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, and Gary Johnson. In the election, Clinton won the popular vote, but lost in the electoral college. Trump won more electoral votes, even though he lost the popular vote by a significant margin.</p>
<p>In 2020, there are four candidates on the ballot: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Tulsi Gabbard. All four candidates are Democrats. Sanders has been leading in most polls, with Biden in second place.</p>
<p>If you do not want to vote for Sanders or Biden, your only other choice is to vote for Warren or Gabbard. Some people may not want to vote for either of those two candidates because they do not think that they have a chance of winning.</p>
<p>However, if you do not want to vote for Sanders or Biden, your only other choice is to vote for Trump or Johnson. Some people may not want to vote for either of those two candidates because they think that they are too similar to each other.</p>
