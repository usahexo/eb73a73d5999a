        <h1 id="Casino-Accidentally-Charges-Resort-Fee-Twice"><a href="#Casino-Accidentally-Charges-Resort-Fee-Twice" class="headerlink" title="Casino Accidentally Charges Resort Fee Twice"></a>Casino Accidentally Charges Resort Fee Twice</h1><p>The management of a casino in Las Vegas is apologizing to customers after it accidentally charged them twice for the resort fee. </p>
<p>The resort fee is a charge that many casinos in Las Vegas levy on customers in order to cover the costs of amenities such as WiFi, gym access, and pool access. The fee is usually around $20 per day, but the casino in question accidentally charged customers twice that amount. </p>
<p>In a statement, the casino’s management apologized for the error and said that it would be refunding customers who were overcharged. The statement also said that the casino was working to ensure that such an incident would not happen again. </p>
<p>This is not the first time that a casino in Las Vegas has made an error with regard to the resort fee. Earlier this year, another casino accidentally charged customers $40 instead of $20 for the fee. </p>
<p>Casinos in Las Vegas have come under fire in recent years for levying these fees on customers. Some people feel that the fees are unfairly priced and are simply a way for casinos to make more money. </p>
<p>However, casinos argue that the fees are necessary in order to maintain the high level of quality of services that they offer guests. They also say that the fees are clearly disclosed before guests check in, so they are aware of what they are paying for.</p>
<h1 id="Bigspin-Casino-Charging-For-Accidental-Charges"><a href="#Bigspin-Casino-Charging-For-Accidental-Charges" class="headerlink" title="Bigspin Casino Charging For Accidental Charges"></a>Bigspin Casino Charging For Accidental Charges</h1><p>Online casino players have voiced their concerns with Bigspin Casino’s recently updated terms and conditions which state that the site can now charge players for any accidental or unauthorized charges. The new policy, which comes into effect on 1st September 2019, means that Bigspin Casino can now levy a charge of up to $50 per incident on players who make accidental or unauthorized deposits to their accounts.</p>
<p>The move has not gone down well with many players who feel that the casino is unfairly trying to profit from innocent mistakes. Some have even threatened to leave the site altogether, while others are demanding that Bigspin Casino reconsider its new policy.</p>
<p>In a statement released on social media, Bigspin Casino said that the updated terms and conditions were necessary in order to protect the site from potential fraudsters. The casino added that it apologizes for any inconvenience caused and that it hopes players will understand the need for such measures.</p>
<p>It’s not clear yet whether or not the new policy will be enough to deter fraudsters, but it’s sure to cause headaches for many players who could be hit with unexpected charges.</p>
<h1 id="Renaissance-Aruba-Resort-And-Casino-Refunding-Accidental-Fees"><a href="#Renaissance-Aruba-Resort-And-Casino-Refunding-Accidental-Fees" class="headerlink" title="Renaissance Aruba Resort And Casino Refunding Accidental Fees"></a>Renaissance Aruba Resort And Casino Refunding Accidental Fees</h1><p>The Renaissance Aruba Resort And Casino has announced that it will be refunding accidental fees that were charged to some guests.<br>As many as fifty guests were mistakenly charged for valet parking, despite not using the service.<br>The resort has said that it will reimburse the fees in full, and has apologized for the error.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that such an incident has happened at the Renaissance Aruba Resort And Casino. In 2016, the hotel charged guests for services they did not use, such as room service and minibar items.<br>The hotel blamed the errors on a new software system that had been rolled out.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the same software system was responsible for the most recent mistake. However, the resort has stated that it is taking steps to ensure that this does not happen again.</p>
<p>Guests who were affected by the mistake are advised to contact the Renaissance Aruba Resort And Casino directly in order to obtain a refund.</p>
<h1 id="Resort-Charged-Twice-For-Accidental-Fees"><a href="#Resort-Charged-Twice-For-Accidental-Fees" class="headerlink" title="Resort Charged Twice For Accidental Fees"></a>Resort Charged Twice For Accidental Fees</h1><p>A recent trip to the Smoky Mountains has led to charges for Resort Fees twice. The first charge wasaccidental, as it was not noticed on the initial reservation. A few weeks after the initial trip, a secondcharge for Resort Fees was noticed on the credit card statement.</p>
<p>After some investigation it appears that the Resort Fee, which is typically $20 per night, was chargedtwice on two different nights. When contacted, the resort acknowledged the mistake and refunded one ofthe charges.</p>
<p>While this may seem like a small issue, it can be quite frustrating when unexpected fees are charged.Especially when they are not noticed until after the fact. This is another reason why it is important toupdate your travel itinerary and double-check all charges before you leave for your trip.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Refunds-Accidental-Charges-After-System-Glitch"><a href="#Casino-Refunds-Accidental-Charges-After-System-Glitch" class="headerlink" title="Casino Refunds Accidental Charges After System Glitch"></a>Casino Refunds Accidental Charges After System Glitch</h1><p>Casinos across the country are issuing refunds to players who were accidentally charged for games they never played. The problem is traced back to a system glitch that allowed some players to be charged for games even after they had already left the casino.</p>
<p>The issue was first reported by a player in Las Vegas who said he was charged $162 for a game of blackjack that he never played. After contacting the casino, he was told that they would refund the money. Since then, other players have come forward with similar stories.</p>
<p>In many cases, players were charged multiple times for the same game. In one instance, a player was reportedly charged $1,700 for a game of blackjack that she never played.</p>
<p>The casinos are blaming the problem on a “technical glitch” and say that they are working to resolve it as quickly as possible. In the meantime, they are issuing refunds to anyone who was affected.</p>
<p>This is just the latest in a series of problems that have plagued the casino industry in recent months. Just last week, a slot machine malfunction caused players at an Atlantic City casino to lose out on millions of dollars in potential winnings.</p>
