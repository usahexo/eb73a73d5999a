NFL Officials: We’re Ready for Sports Betting"></a>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver: Legalized sports betting is coming.2. NFL Officials: We’re Ready for Sports Betting</h1><p>As the sports world awaits a verdict on New Jersey’s decade-long legal battle to legalize sports betting, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has already come out in support of the move.</p>
<p>“I believe that we will see legalized sports betting in the United States within the next five years,” Silver said at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference on Friday.</p>
<p>The NFL isn’t quite as bullish on sports betting as Silver is, but league officials say they’re ready for it if and when it happens.</p>
<p>“Our job is to protect the integrity of the game and ensure that there is no manipulation of the results,” NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told Reuters. “If it’s legalized, we’ll work with our clubs to understand what kind of monitoring and protections are necessary.”</p>
<p>Both leagues are likely eager to get into the sports betting business because they see it as a way to increase revenue. The American Gaming Association estimates that $150 billion is gambled on U.S. sports each year,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> most of which is bet illegally.</p>
<p>But not everyone is on board with legalizing sports betting. Some people worry that it will lead to more gambling addiction and corruption in college athletes.</p>
<p>“Sports gambling changes everything,” David Schwarz, spokesperson for the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion, told Reuters. “It creates an economic motive for match fixing and other nefarious activities.”</p>
<p>Others argue that legalized sports betting would create jobs and generate tax revenue for states. A study by Eilers Research found that if Nevada were to legalize online sports betting, it would bring in $25 million in state tax revenue annually.</p>
<h1 id="3-Pau-Gasol-Calls-NBA’s-Proposed-Jersey-Ads-‘Absurd’"><a href="#3-Pau-Gasol-Calls-NBA’s-Proposed-Jersey-Ads-‘Absurd’" class="headerlink" title="3. Pau Gasol Calls NBA’s Proposed Jersey Ads ‘Absurd’"></a>3. Pau Gasol Calls NBA’s Proposed Jersey Ads ‘Absurd’</h1><p>Los Angeles Lakers center Pau Gasol has spoken out against the NBA’s proposed plan to sell ad space on player jerseys, calling the idea “absurd.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s a terrible idea. I don’t like it,” Gasol said Sunday. “It’s absurd. It’s ridiculous.”</p>
<p>The NBA is considering a proposal that would allow teams to sell advertising space on the front of jerseys, a move that is expected to generate $100 million in additional revenue each year.</p>
<p>Gasol, who has played in the NBA for 13 seasons, said he does not believe fans would welcome such a change.</p>
<p>“Fans don’t want that,” he said. “They don’t want to see ads on jerseys. It’s something that I think should not happen. It goes against what we’re trying to do as players and create a brand and an identity.”</p>
<h1 id="4-Top-NCAA-Basketball-Coaches-React-to-Proposed-Sports-Betting-Rules"><a href="#4-Top-NCAA-Basketball-Coaches-React-to-Proposed-Sports-Betting-Rules" class="headerlink" title="4. Top NCAA Basketball Coaches React to Proposed Sports Betting Rules"></a>4. Top NCAA Basketball Coaches React to Proposed Sports Betting Rules</h1><p>When the NCAA Men’s Basketball Rules Committee released its proposal for legalized sports betting, reactions from top coaches poured in. The committee’s recommendation would allow states to legalize sports betting, with provisions that include a 10 percent royalty on bets placed on college games.</p>
<p>Reactions from some of the biggest names in college basketball were mixed, but most coaches seemed to agree that something needs to be done to address the current state of sports gambling.</p>
<p>“It’s a step in the right direction,” Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski said after his team’s practice Wednesday. “I don’t think it goes far enough, but it is a start and we need to start somewhere. It creates another opportunity for people to lose money and for organized crime to be involved. But hopefully this will get cleaned up and we can get more people betting legally on our games. I think that would be great for college basketball.”</p>
<p>Krzyzewski is one of the most opinionated coaches when it comes to gambling and was one of the first major coaches to speak out against illegal sports gambling in 2007.</p>
<p>Rick Pitino, who was famously caught up in the Louisville basketball scandal, had a different perspective on the proposed rules.</p>
<p>“It’s not good,” Pitino told The Associated Press. “It’s not good because there’s no regulation as far as I’m concerned.”</p>
<p>Pitino has been outspoken against gambling throughout his career and believes that it opens up players and coaches to potential corruption. He also noted that the proposed rules wouldn’t do anything to help schools who have had their reputations tarnished by scandals related to point shaving or illegal gambling activities.</p>
<p>“I think it hurts more than helps,” he said. “What are you going to do with these schools that have had scandals? Are you going to take their basketball away now also? I just don’t see how this helps.”</p>
<p>Kansas head coach Bill Self also weighed in on the new proposal, noting that he understands both sides of the issue. He acknowledged that legalization could bring extra revenue into college athletics, but also believes that there are some inherent risks associated with gambling.</p>
<h1 id="5-Billy-Walters-Convicted-on-Fraud-Charges-But-Not-Gambling"><a href="#5-Billy-Walters-Convicted-on-Fraud-Charges-But-Not-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="5. Billy Walters Convicted on Fraud Charges, But Not Gambling"></a>5. Billy Walters Convicted on Fraud Charges, But Not Gambling</h1><p>In a stunning turn of events, well-known sports gambler Billy Walters was convicted on fraud charges on Tuesday, but not gambling. The trial lasted two weeks and jurors deliberated for just six hours before finding the 70-year-old guilty on all 10 counts of securities and wire fraud.</p>
<p>Walters was accused of making more than $40 million in illegal profits through insider trading. Prosecutors argued that he received confidential information about Dean Foods from its former CEO Tom Davis and used it to make millions in illicit profits.</p>
<p>Davis testified against Walters during the trial, telling jurors that he passed along secrets about the company to help Walters repay a debt. He also said Walters threatened to reveal their relationship if Davis ever stopped cooperating with him.</p>
<p>However, Walters was cleared of all charges related to gambling. This came as a surprise to many observers, as the evidence against him seemed overwhelming. In fact, at one point during the trial prosecutors actually played a wiretapped phone call in which Walters bragged about his winnings at the casino.</p>
<p>Despite this setback, Walters is still facing a possible prison sentence of up to 65 years. He is scheduled to be sentenced in December and is expected to appeal his conviction.</p>
